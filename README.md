## About

In this project we aimed to create machine learning models to grade English essays written by 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs).
The resulting model can be used to alleviate the burden of grading on teachers, who are often underpaid and overworked, while giving nearly instant feedback to ELLs.

To start with this project, you take a look at the corresponding Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-english-language-learning).

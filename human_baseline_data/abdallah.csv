3213,E103955391AB,"Yeah we all have our own freedom but well that's not always true a lot of people let others control them. So it is said

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment""

Like i said we all have our own idividuality that what makes us we have our own way of being, own name and own way of looking we are just our selves. Specifically individuality shows us that not everything should be given to you if you want something you work hard for it but also it's a sign of your own development that you can do everthing by your self but it's because you are who you are and no one can change you. Therefore, itis proven that it's better to be individual than anybody else just giving you everything by hand .

""FREEDOM!"" is a good word all of us love to hear. When you realize you can do anything by yourself you feel like no one can stop or as free as the wind but theres always going to be obsticles without a doubt. To be Indivdual it can happen to any one such as a kid who has learned to do thier stuff alone or when you move out of your parents house and get your own home. It honestly can happen to anyone becuase thiers so many types to define the word individual. well to fell free is not a bad thing after all .

When your individual you mean something to this world because you think about yourself. You set your own goals and accomplish them and you maintian yourself the way you are it's even more better becuase it's the hugest goal anybody should have to not let anybody change you wreck all you have accomplished. To your self you feel like you value your self and it's not bad at all to value yourself because it biulds self confidence within you and that means you have you feet on the ground and yeah your ready to face any obsticale.

No one should define you except you because the world will defenitly try to change you but if you don't aceppt it won't happen like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" whom we have someone to look up to and understand that to be inividual is okay.",4,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3.5
3540,F094225CAE4F,"I am agree with this idea because is the best opportunity not only to the hispanic people, well for everyone who want to follow his/her dreams, and has responsability or lower resources.

I think is great idea, because some students sometime or usually work. One reason why the students do not go to the high school is because they do not have enough time to do homework, study, or just hey want to make more money.

Rarely students really want to learn, or to feel like they need to go to the college or university, cause they have a few time to go to the high school. This idea is great and amazing to someone really dream and feel that the high school is the door to the college, university, or opportunity to do your dreams real. The advantage is if you finish high school in three years you have more probability to go to the college or university. The disadvantage is that three years would be very stressing and harding time, because you need really to focus in the high school and all that stuff like: homework, worksheet, project, study, or simple attention the class. The good news is you can do anything if you have purpose, if you have motivation and completely focus in your dreams and What do you really want to be or to do?. Do not worry is you feel fear that is normal everybody feel like that about the test, high school, or dreams.

I think is a big opportunity to me; well, I work and really need pass my last year, but sometime feel like ""I cant anymore"", and I want to leave or run of the high school and just work, and work, and work, but everytime I think like that just say me "" NEVER GIVE UP "", always remember everything I did, why am i here?,and How too far wil be go for my dreams?.

Sometime the life is very unjust, cause some people have the opportunity of study withouth work, While others people do not have chooses, and that is the situation where the hispanic people live today. Well, that it's my point and why I am agree with this awesome idea. I have been thinking this system or program will be helpfull and better for every student that the system we have today. My view is if you finish the high school in three years, will be more effective, easy, and fast to be gratuated.

Thank you for your attention. ",2.5,3,2.5,2,2.5,2
149,0B6316123881,"Duke Ellington said, "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" Do you think a problem is a good way to learn form your mistake? Learning from your mistake is a great way to know, what you did wrong, and how you can fix the problem.

What does he mean by "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best.""? A problem is a mistake you did, and doing your best is improving form your mistakes. Some people learn from their mistake, and others don't. People who do learn from their mistake can help others and their self.

I do agree that problems is a chance for all of us to do are best. Their some people who don't really care if it happens again. We should all care about our mistakes because if we didn't care our mistakes would happen again , and if that mistake was bad, then you should care.

I made lots of mistake like failing a grade because i didn't care about school , but then i change and stared to be more motivated and now that helps me work hard to get my dream job. One of my other mistake is my anger. I would always get angry but I always try to clam down because I would always take it out on people, but it won't hurt to try to learn form your mistakes.

Everyone can learn from their mistakes and it won't hurt to try. The benefits is knowing what to do when the mistakes happens again. Like what Duke Ellington once said, ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best.""",3,4,2,2.5,3,3.5

1626,7B5F5B33B566,"When people ask for advice

, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions really is a foundation to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it.

In the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success. Next, advice from others can make you more wiser when you make your own choices, if

Abraham

Lincoln never saw how African Americans were treated for there skin color he would have never signed the documents for slavery to be band. if he never got advice he mostly likely would have never Andres the problems with having that toxic racism. If it wasnt for him, it would still be here today thanks to out 16th President, which boils down to good thinking and advice. At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel, father, and mother. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that. Only instead its intellects make the right choice to help you.

In Conclusion, advice is there to help you, opinions are there to guide you to something that gives you smarts to making the right choices in the world we live in live, sure not all opinions hear might not be in your favor. But just hear them out and be the best you that you want to be shaped in, advice will make yo wiser and more aware of scenarios. ",4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5
490,2538542762C0,"One topic that is frecuently dabated is if the schools should control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Some people think that the school should take control of the students extra activities and extra time. They feel that students need more educational activities to enrich their knowledgement at school. I believe that students should decided what they want to do with their extra time after school because some students have to work to help their families, some students have to get home earlier to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work and students like to do some other activities like sports, art or homework.

First, students have to work to help their parents and sibilings, it could be difficult to work and study at the same time, you get tired and all you think is get home and sleep, students who work do not have time to study for a quiz, test or do homework. However. Study hall could help them finish their homework, students who work don't get involved in extracurricular activities bacause they don't have time to make it through. But also they work for saving money for college, this is an a good idea because you are investing for your future. That is why students who work have to give up with some other acctivities that they want to do.

Second, some students have to get home early to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work, most of them can't afford a babysitter, this students might have the time to involve in a club, probably when one of their parents have a day off. They can do homework or other assigments for school or home while they are taking care of their sibbilings like made food for them, clean the house, laundry etc. That can get difficult for them because they have different responsabilities at the same time that they have to take care of school.

Third, other students like to do different activities like sports, they like to exercide everyday after school, there are many sports that hey can practice such as bascketball, baseball, tennis, gymnastics, etc. other students like to do art, envirroment and learn another language they can sign up for any club that they are interested on. This students are deffinetly involve in extracurricular activities from school, but they decided what they want to do with this extra time and the school do not have to tell them what should they do.

As have you read this are my reasons why I believe schools should not take control of the students activities after school. When we get to know each others personal dreams and problems this world is going to change because we are going to understand how people work hard to get succes and happiness. ",3,2.5,3,2.5,3,2.5

There are many reasons why students should perform community service. Performing community service helps your community and other communities. Your community will be cleaner and fresh. Not just students but everyone in this country should have community service. When your community is full with trash. No one will care, but you can make a change. You will need a helping hand to help you with community service.

In streets, public places, and school campus, there are people littering. If you care about your community, you should gather people to help you clean it. Even if the trash is not yours, pick it up. It is not just picking up trash. There are planting trees, etc. So, when you are done picking up the trash, you could continue planting trees and flowers. To make it stand out.

Some will said you'll grow but won't reach their beyond what they mastered.

In the pass year I played a Villain before I reach goal becoming beyond with a instrument that I didn't know how to play, I master how to soccer for the first when I was little, and at the end of the day your going to be beyond great when you don't give up.

When I was 6th grade in middle school I never though I was going to learn how to play instrument for the first time in my life. The instrument that I'm now play is Villain my brother though I wasn't good enough to play a instrument. I practice every days to get better and to try my best. I played three year in middle school I was getting good and then I love how sound made with bows and string. The teacher once said if stop playing then your going to forget the string note and how to used correctly. When I got to middle I learned how to play a interment for the for time in my life become beyond. I didn't stop growing I kept growing to become better to play.

Why won't we reach our goal then become beyond because doing something beyond your reaching a goal to finish. This was a time where I want to learn how to play a sport. When I was little I wanted to play soccer but I didn't started learning until I was 10 years old. My goal was to learn how to play soccer, until one day I was at the park with my family and friend I learn how to play soccer. My uncle tough me how to played soccer for the first time.

He showed me how to kick the inside and outside of my feet. My uncle told me that I was fast learner that I kicked correctly with forced. So we played soccer just kicking back and forth until knew how to kick. When I was 7th grade I sign up for the girl soccer team for the school. When I made the team I was exacted because I never though I going play for school soccer team and it was the first to play. The couch liked how I played but my friend though I was beyond great but I didn't believe them. When I got to 8th grade I wanted to sign up again because some of my friend was joining, then when I made in the team next then I know they voted for me to become captain for the girl soccer team. The coach was beyond how I played for the game I made 8 goal in the season but I never stopped playing soccer. Until the moment in my life I knew that I had master my goal.

I'm 16 year old about to turn seventeen in July I have reach so many goals in my life and then it when beyond. I learn so many thing on my own because my parent didn't know English. At the end of day I had teacher and friends that help me all my school year. The one key that my parent tough me was never give up on yourself, if you don't understand the problem then go to the next problem then come back to finish the rest.

2794,CC2EC6C74865,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because to have success is important to do a great effort. It is very important in the life, but to learn the value that it has sometimes failure is also necessary. Also success is not something easy to get, but without loss calm could get it with enthusiasm. Success has an role important in the life of many people since it is something that is necessary in their academic level, their jobs, and their goals to have a better future.

First, success is difficult to get at the academic level, but the students need know that although they are failing with effort they could get it. Since to get it, they need to study a lot without loss the hope of getting success. Also they need to practice each step to do more easy their activities and have a better success. For example: if students loss any test they need to study and practice a lot to get their success with enthusiam. For this reason, the importance of the success also depend of failure to failure to learn.

Second, in the work, the success depend of many dedication and is absolutely necessary working a lot to get it. If the employees is not working well, the problem could be that the company not could have success and the employees could be exonerated of their jobs. Moreover, if they are exonerated their jobs, they need to looking for another jobs without loss the calm to get their new jobs with a great enthusiasm. For example: An employee was farawell for does not a good report, but continuous practicing and learned to do a good report after that the employee found a good job did a very nice job. Sometimes the success in the work is not easy to get, but neither impossible.

Finally, the people have many goals in their future, but also have obstacles to get success. The goals are difficul to accomplish, but not difficult to do. Furthermore, to realize their goals, they need to keep completely firm their ideas to find the success. Sometimes, they can failure, but they have the capacity to do anything and accomplishment their success for example, A family want to go to the beach, the problem is that they do not loss money to their vactions, yet they were to the beach because winning money working hard and with a great emotion they arrived to the beach. All goals can get with dedication and effort.

In conclusion, from failure to failure, the success can be possible and get it with a great enthusiasm. In the academic level, job and goals for future there are not impossible to accomplish the success. Does not matter the difficulty that everything have, the most important is realizing all with success, but without loss enthusiasm.

Its fun to do many activities outdoors and its also good for you to be outside moving around and doing things.

Spending time outdoors are great for doing activities,and to see what other things you can do at parks. For one, playing catch is a good activity to enjoy with others, and to move around. People can find that playing catch is a good activity to enjoy outdoors, because most people play it differently and many of them can learn how to play, its also a good way to play fair with others, and to throw/catch a ball.

Secondly, riding bikes is a great activity to do at a park with your family or friends. Therefore, riding bikes is an amazing activity for outdoors, you can enjoy riding along the streets, and to enjoy the outside nature by looking around the park and to hear the people playing around having fun outside.

On the other hand, doing any other activities are good to enjoy outside. For example, playing football is a good game to spend time outside practicing or playing with friends, and tag is another game that kids love enjoying outside running around and laughing and playing fair with other childrens on the grass or even just chasing little things that they see, like a dog they like to go after a dog and pet it.

Conclusion.

1468,71A9098715EB,"Self-reliance is better then hoping someone makes the best decisions for you. This is because people need to follow there own instincts in life no one knows them like they do and what is best for them. Why would anyone want someone to make decisions for them, People will always want what is best for them so if people trust someone to pick a important life decision what if they pick something that will help them in there long run and not you.

My older brother 5 years ago was done with school and was planning his career he wanted to be a engineer but my mom and dad wanted him to be doctor; He made his own decision at the end and now lives his best life with a kid and wife. If he had chose to be a doctor he would be in school still and never meet his wife. This shows how important it is to trust your self even if no one agrees with you.

People will say that someone with more life experious will help others more then they can help them-self but they can make it so much further then others. Im not saying people should't have rolemodle just don't do something because someone else did it do it better then they ever could. My friend Generic_Name wanted to be a football player his whole life he was the best in our middle school team, but his mom and dad hated the idea they thought all football players end up hurt so he did't play in high school he did't like any other sports so he just went to school and went home. this left Generic_Name with not that many friends and he is sad and deperested today.

Making your own decisions all the time can be hard and at some point you may fail but if you keep trying you can make it big one day. There are many reasons to have someone make decisions for you it would be much less stressful and you would have less chance of failing, but everyone need to grow up at some point and do what is best for them, You can't live under someone your whole life at some point you will be on your own.

Those are the reasons I believe everyone should make there own decisions in the long run you will be 10 times the person if you trust your-self and do it your way. A person should never put there life in the hand of anyone but them-self. If someone stops talking to you because they dont like a decision you make and did't do what they said to do then they don't deserve to be in your life.",3.5,3,3,3,3.5,3.5

Writing SOL

Where is one place you would like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because they have really nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family in Florida.

The place I would visit is my grandfather grave because my grandfather had died last year

To, begin The reason why I picked Florida is because I have really nice, cool family in Florida.

My grandfather had dies last year after he had fell and hit his head on the ground.

He is special to me because if it was'nt for him I would not be playing soccer right now.

Every time I score a goal i always do a celebration for him.

I have something valuable of his and that is the gold chain that I got on now that he gave me and I had never took the chain ever since he gave it to me.

I will take off this chain the day I die.

I had promised him that I will love soccer forever and go to college to play soccer.

The college that I'm going to is Generic_School.

The reason why I would like to go to this college is because I had went there for a scholarship and I had got the scholarship and they said that I am really good for my age.

Here go some tips if your not good at soccer you should go outside and practice makes perfect.

If your not good at it you should try I mean it is really not a hard sport if you think about it.

If someone say that you suck let them keep on telling you that for me I will take that as motivation.

The reason why I love soccer so much is because of my grandfather he loved soccer just like me.

Everytime I had went to Florida to go visit family me and my grandfather we would always watch soccer games and tell me some formation to play when I grow up.

The favorite things that my grandfather love to do was drawing, playing soccer and teach me some new moves.

Every morning we would wake up he will always take me and my brother to waffle house and we would tell some stories to me and my brother about what he did when he was growing up.

When he had fell and went to the hospital I was not but when my mom face time my aunt he found out that we could not move body shoulders down and then he had to get some brain surgies and all that then the week after all that he had died and we face timed my aunt and he prayed on the phone and we all was crying.

I had a soccer game the day after he died and I had scored 6 goals and every time I had scored I had always kissed my hand and point it up to the sky.

After the game I was crying because I was proud of my self that I played a game with all that stress over my shoulders and I said to my self I did that for my grandfather.

Then right after the game my mom had came to me and started crying because I told her that I was going to score 6 goals just for my grandfather and I did what I said I was going to do.

That night I was praying and telling my grandfather that I had scored 6 goals just for him and I was saying to my head that I was going to do that more often.

My next soccer game I had scored 5 goals but every time I go on the pitch I had always kissed my chain and touched the ground and point at the sky and I still do that today.

My soccer game in 2 more weeks and I am going to do what I need to do to take my team to the championship and I will play all my soccer games just for my grandfather.

All the soccer games I play they will always be for my grandfather and he will never forget that and if I have to do anything just to get some goals I will then just for him.

When I was in Florida my grandfather had bought me a soccer poster and a soccer jersey of my favorite soccer player.

He had got a jersey customize for that say my last name and my favorite which is number 7 and that is my favorite soccer player number to.

When I was little he had always send me some of his drawing and like always write a little back that say I will always love u miyo and miyo mean son.

When I was 10 years old he came down here to Virginia and he was visiting and he will always wake up at 4 o clock in the morning to go fora bike ride and when he came back he had always fix breakfast for us.

In the afternoon he will always 1 v 1 me or my brother in soccer for some money like 10 dollars but that is if we beat him do.

This why I play soccer just because of him.

Like when I get frustrated in the soccer game I will always take a deep breath and think about my grandfather and that is what always calm me down when I get frustrated.

He had always tell me if someone is talking trash always smile because that dont talk the most is the most strong ones in the game and I always tell them look at the score board.

Here go the reason why I would like to go to Florida:

Family and my grandfather grave.

I would like to go to Generic_City studios.

Go to the beach and get some nice weather.

In conclusion, Where is one place you will like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because Florida have nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family down in Florida.

The place I would like to visit is my grandfather grave. Another place I would like to visit is Generic_City studios because like your like in a movie because there are people that are dressed up as some characters.

Another place I would like to visit is the indoor soccer field and play some soccer there with some family and maybe some new friends if I meet some there.   ",3,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5
2828,CE19B516A167,"should the school board add one and a half hour to school each day? The school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. I agree with the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school because it would effect the students learning and help them get more smarter and it would effect the school worker's because they money they get payed will increase.

1 first of all the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school each day.

if the school board add one and half hour to school if will effect the student because they will be able to have more time to study with they teacher which help them gain more learning. for an example when Generic_Name was 10years old in Generic_City, he use to not like school because he had school from 7am to 4pm and the teacher's use to force them to do homework,classwork and all the learning he needed it felt like being a maid having someone telling him to do this and that he hated the teacher but he learned a lot from them and him and his classmate still cared they teacher's teaching everywhere they went and it's very helpful, for an example they teacher's was like your parent's telling you to do something you don't wanna do they know is good for you but still you don't wanna do it so they force you to do it then you get mad over them for doing that which they find it helpful for you later in life in fact you hate them at that moment for what they did, but after years when your adult you get struggle about something and you remember what she thought you and you find it helpful the how our teacher's was like back then in Generic_City, the more hour's we had the more smarter we got . This evidence show's that the more time we got learning with our teacher's the more smarter we got. clearly sometime's the teacher's rush teaching when they do not have enough time and that does not help the student so the more time the teacher's get to teach the more student understand the subject well without rushing through the subject.

2 I agree with the school adding one hour and a half to school each day.

perhaps if they do add one hour and a half to school each day it really help the student and teacher's because they will have enough time learning not rush through learning. for an example when i was in school back then in Generic_City, Generic_Name was in classes doing his work but the classes hour's was short so this time when he did not have enough time to do the classwork in class the class hours was like

1hour and 30minites in math class the teacher told us to '' turn your work in it's time to go '' innocent didn't have enough time so he try to rush through it so he can get it done.

after week's innocent got 60% on my classwork he was disappointed in himself innocent wished he had more time to finish it was not the teacher's fault so he didn't blame the teacher because they did they best to make sure we had enough time. if we had enough time it would had really helped us all student's and teacher's.

in addition for student's to have better grade they need more time to focus and do they work in class.

clearly if school board add one hour and a half to school it will effect student's grade because they will have enough time to do they work in class and not rush.

In conclusion the school board should add one hour and a half because it will effect student learning and it will also effect they grades too so it will be a good thing to add one hour and half to school each day sometimes the student don't have enough time to do they work and they need sometime to finish but they can't and that effect the decrease the student grades. like in the story when the boy name Generic_Name in his school they didn't have enough time to do they classwork so he rushed through it and got bad grade, so if student's have enough time to do they work in class it would be very helpful to the student's. if the school board add one hour and half the student's grade will be different all they need is just more time to do they work in class and not rush through they work the more time they get to do they work the better they grades will get and the smarter they become.

3333,E70DD00622DB,"From my personal experience back in middle school, I had to use technology for many different reasons. One of the reasons were for research purposes. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on people's lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient.

One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. For example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. Many schools started providing laptops and iPad's to students who are unable to connect online. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work.

Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information.

Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. For example, many custom equipment's and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world.

Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it.

Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe. In conclusion, technology has had a positive effect on people's lives and that is due to many reasons such as online researching, online shopping, and wide spread communication.

It is a honor for me to respond your statement about human individuality and I agree with your statement and i believe that be yourself in a world is hard. The world is something that the human we can not answer and be yourself is definitely the same is hard everything is hard but you can get a lot achievements for do and treat the best the you can.

First, I think the when you are alone and the city or other place and you got this situation you are alone there is not family, friends, parents nobody is there but you have to be sure that you can live without people that grow and start think what is going to happen. I believe that everyone can do everything that we want each achieve or something else because everyone can be smart, we are the people that we wanna be and yes if you are alone in the a big world you are going to scared first you have to work and pay everything that you want but that is help you to get the greatest accomplshment.

Second, be yourself is everything that all people want because to can express the real person that you are not a fake person cause if you are in a meeting or school or whatever place you have to be yourself and demonstrate the person who are you inside the feeling the you have all the characteristics that you have the point is to desmonstrate the world the you can be yourself and make more to get something else and be something else.

Next, desmonstrate the person who are you one reason is you can get more friends because your are showing to other person who real you are.

In clonclusion, be yourself in a world is more better then not we have to continue trying the person who wanna be for get more achievements and other things. Thanks for give me this opportunity to response you what i think and give you my opinion.

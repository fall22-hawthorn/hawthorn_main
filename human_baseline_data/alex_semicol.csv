733;3898358B58BB;To conserve energy and resources, Some businesses have adopted a four day work week, With each day consisting of ten hours. My school should not follow this model or even consider extending the school day by two hours. At my school a full day of school consists of seven hours. Seven hours is more then enough, Now having it to be nine hours would be very overwhelming for everybody. Extending it two more hours is too much stress on the students , as well as the teachers. Also most students have a part time job after school and won't fit everyone's schedule. There is a lot to do after school and extending school two more hours would not help. It also would not only affect the students but the teachers too. Some teachers have a second job to go to after school, Some teachers have children to go take care of at home. Also it is scientifically proven, That if students are in school for more than the seven hours they usually are in school, The students mind shut down. once the mind shuts down the body does too. So whenever the teacher is teaching the students isn't picking up the information and isnt learning anything. The student isnt focousing and also tired. So it would not benefit the students much , by adding the two hours. It will most likely have the students failing, because they're not leaning or doing their work. No good benefit will come out of extending the school day, Only bad. The school board should leave it how it is. My school should not follow this model by extending the school day by two hours.;3;2.5;3;3;3;3
2244;A80542F83A7C;"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. It would help the students who had a bad experience at school. Students who are in their comfort zone will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. Some may argue that student should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students that are at home will most likely be distracted, and will not finish their agenda. Some students will have a hard time teaching their selves. Also it would not give the students, the chance of experiencing what it is like in school.

It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. Every students grew up differently, and also some other students have had a bad childhood experienced and it reflected on how they act in their current life, by giving them a chance to study where they are comfortable at would give them a chance to show what they can really do, because not many students have that many option or chances to show their full potential. They can not do that by having to stay in school, and force them selves to socialize to other students or teachers it would all just be a distraction.

Also, it would help the students who had a bad experienced at school. Students who experienced getting bullied at school can caused them to stop going or the will to study and be successful in life. Bullying even nowadays still have so much impact on why some schools are really not on their high standards. And it showed that students are highly affected by it. It showed that it is a nightmare to some students, but now having the online classes will pull them away from that and really focused on their studies.

Furthermore, students who are in their comfort zone, will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. By having that comfortless and being in your zone of learning, will highly benefit you to show your potential. Being in the right environment also help students focused. Students who is really serious about being successful and have that high standards are more likely to be successful. Family can also motivate them, to keep on pushing even though it might be hard for them but having your family by your side can really motivate you to keep on pushing.

Therefore, i really believed that, students should really have the option to take online classes or video conferencing. by just having that it would benefit lots of student, who are having problems being socialize to other students or teachers. it would help the students who had a bad experience in school. And it also would benefit the students who are in their comfort zone, and being able to focused and having that chance would increase the chances of more students will be successful.";3.5;3.5;3;3;3.5;3

Although many of the teenagers are constantly restricted nevertheless, the teenagers more younger`s that 18 has their own`s responsibilities and obligations to themselves and for their families because, the teenager`s need education, a home and money.

The teenager`s need education, being from elementary until high school grades. In 5 or 10 years in the future the teenager been the support from the economy, the country and the next generation.

A home the teenager`s need a place to call ""home"" that place where him not only can relax, rather he should be tranquil and save from the rest of the world; that place where you know that someone is to waiting for you with a smile and food, sure will be you should reprimand but you know that is for your well-being and future.

Logically the money is the more important fact in the teenagers life, to won it is necessary to get a part-time job or work in the weekend, that is where is the problem to obtain money the teenager`s from 16 to 18 year`s has to use their value time after school to work. The part-times are approximate 6 hours; if a student work from 4. pm to 9p. m there is no problem, but if a student work between the curfew from 5p. m to 10p. m the big problem is that the teenagers will been accused be breaking the law when it did not happen is just a unfairly interference from the city.

In summary: The children`s from today will be the teenager of tomorrow and the adults from the new generation.

a home is the best place to a teenager to feel comfortable, save and tranquil. The money is the most important think for a teenager in the present and for their future and the time is a necessary value to get it.";2;2;2;2;2;2
2024;98CD7819C7EF;"Some people believes that making mistakes is how peoples move on to success. Othes believes that is if we are determinated person and having positives thoughts without limitations. Some others people realized right before they are committing the mistake and they are just avoiding them. Although some say, successing in life without failures, our lifes wouldn't make sense, because we would not learn how to be success in our life's. Actually, successing in life with failures is more baneficial to our life's, because we learn how to believes on us, and we may have a life without doubts.

As a result, if we are the kind of person who doesn't makes any mistakes and realizing to success. i think that we wouldn't know what are we doing wrong to be determinated person. Also most of the people wouldn't have knowlwdge to succes in their lifes. Actually, when people cling to themselves isn't good for their goals in lifes.

However, I believe that making failures is how we move on to succe ss in life and is more beneficial to our life's. Otherwise i can tell the 80% of the people belives that making failures is how we learn to success and we become a civilized person. Sometimes most of the people have goals to achieve in their life's. As a matter of fact,

when we are setting goals to our life's and we can't get that goal it's because we are doing something wrong and we don't even realize what's wrong with it. its when we are learning to be focus and making sure next time to be success and whatever we did wrong.

In fact, sometimes it's hard to when we have had failures a fewers times, because we do not want to commit mistakes, but i think that is a beneficial for most of the people. Because the most mistakes we have and at the same time we overcome to have more experience in life. First of all, when we fix what we did wrong. Also I believe that fixing problems is a good way to be success in life. second of all, my suggestions are that to be a positive person, and determinate, smart, and wise person it make us a better person in success.

In conclusion, some people believes that having failures is how we are success in life and others don't think that way. However i do believe so that to be a success person, we have to fail a fewers times, because it's really important to me to be a determinate person. I think that those are my thoughts to be a better person in successful. and by the way, I'm totally agree that we have to fail first to be a success person.";2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5
3725;F86CA3BFAB20;"I take ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Because the more you do the more you get done. And that will make your life so much easier. You should should never wait for tomorrow to do something if you can do it today. Also, you can't be idle for the rest of your life. You can't be successful if you're just going to idle. To be soemthing in life you have to work hard for it. You always have to push yourself to the max limit. But at the end it'll all be worth it.

I remember my mom always used to tell me that ""Never wait for tomorrow to do something that you can do today."" And that will be in my head for the rest of my life. I use that quote to motivate myself when I'm doing homework or going to the gym etc. It always works and i will always live to that. My whole family lives to that qutoe.

The world would be such a better place if people didn't idle. If people were determined to work hard for themselves, everybody in the world would be succesful. Also more people would be enjoying a more wealthy life. Less people wouldn't need a place to sleep. Their would be more people enventing stuff to make the world a better place. Everybody in the world would have water and food.

You would make your whole family proud. Give back to the people. Do unreal things that no human has ever done before. Maybe even go to every planet to see if humans are able to live there. Their would be less crimes and less lives lost. Also more opportunities for people to succeed.

Finally, Thomas Jefferson wrote that quote for a reason. For people to succeed in life. It was for people to look at the quote and actually do it and not idle. Thomas Jefferson wanted people to do great things. He wanted people to always be doing and not idle. If you're determined you will succeed. Never give up.";2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;3
1957;93C575DB7931;"Would you rather ask one person or multiple for advice

I think that if you talk to more than one person for advice it will hep you more .One time i saw this quot by Lebron James that said if you need advice always ask more than one because one person could be right and the other could be not be right so dont be scared to ask more than one person there is noting wrong about asking the person you look up to. it will most likely be better if you ask multiple people for good advice.

If you are a person that does not like taking to other people you can just go to one person or you can try something different and ask someone else but if you just want to ask one person you have to go to someone you trust so they can give you some good feed back and good information. If i was to ask someone for advice i would go to a person that is very wise and makes smart choices so they can help me make a smart choice so i dont make the bad choices. If you need good advice make sure your going to the right person because you do not to be getting bad information if you have bad information you can make some bad choices.

Getting advice from one person can also be good because what if your telling them personal thing they can keep it a secret but if you tell multiple people your personal information can get out there and can start getting bulled and you would not be able to trust anyone again so that is why sometimes you just have to tell one person if it is important information. And if you just dont trust anyone you can just go to your consular because your consular will never share your information with anyone and she will under stand you more because it could of happen to her as a child so one person can also be helpful.

Dont forget asking for advice can always be useful if its one person or it multiple people it can still help you but if it is a person that does bad things and you ask him for advice he can tell you to do the things he does and you will turn out just like him so do not do to someone for advice if they dont make good choice. advice can change pepole live if it is good.";2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5
831;400E5AA27067;"It has been said that first impressions are impossible to change, I disagree with this stiemant. The reason

I disagree with this is because first of all first impressions are a snap chat of who you are.

Second of all the more time you spend with a person the more likely that they will change there mind of who they thought you were from the first time they meet you. At this time of peride people are starting to get the idea that first impressions are't always correct, so they are willing to give a second chance.

First impressions are a snap chat of who you are, for me personally first impressions are always heard because based on the few second I spend talking to a person they will always think of me as that person specie if am never going to see them aging. Job interview is a big one because based on how you present your self at that moment of time will determan whether you get the job or not, and you might get nerves and act a sertine way that will not help you get the job even tho that's not who you really are. For example like a year ago I had soccer tryouts for a big soccer team the whole month I have been training and feeling good, but when the day came I was nerves because I never had the chance to tryout for a big team like that. I ended up not getting into the soccer team because the whole time I was worried what time the coaches will think of me and they were not impress with me the first, but this year I made it into the team the coaches liked me because I was much comfortable on the ball this time then last time and the coaches changed there mind about me . What am trying to say is first impressions are not impossible to change.

The more time you spend with a person the more likely that they will change there mind, Sometimes you will like person based on for the few seconds you seen them or talk to them, but then when you spend more time with me you come to find out that they are not as much as inserting as they seam. For example I had this kid in my class he was funny and seem inserting. but the more I got to now him i found out that he is funny when they are a group of people around him but when you talk to him one on one he is like a whole different person. This just goes to show that it is not just bad first impressions that are not impossible it's the good one's too.

People are starting to get the idea that first impressions are't always correct, Job are starting to understand that first impressions are not always correct for that reason they are willing to have two job interviews with. Sometimes it might be first on the phone than in person or just have two job interviews in person and I think that is a good idea spicily for people like me who are not good at first impressions.

inconclution,

Some people might say first impressions are impossible to change and I can see where they are coming from, but all am trying to say is the more time you spend with a person you are going to have more understanding of who they are. The only time I would say first impressions are almost impossible to change is if you are going to see the person just for one time and never see them aging. If that is the case than what ever the image of you they have that will just be it but be sides that first impressions are not impossible to change.";3;2.5;3;3;2.5;3
2755;CA4941643D09;"Thomas Jefferson wrote to never to be idle and he believes that is better to always be doing something, because if you do not try to do things you never will get a purpose in life, even though some says that inactivity also serve a purpose. Do things make you do better in life, also is better to have the mind busy in something, if you do things you can be someone in life.

Although Thomas Jefferson believes that is always better be doing something that doing nothing, because if you do not try to do things in life you will never get a purpose, actually Thomas Jefferson says that if inactivity also serve a purpose, in my opinion people do not like to do things because they do not want to be someone in life and they are lazy.

Although Thomas Jefferson believes that is always better be doing something that be doing nothing, because if you do not try to do something in life you will never get a purpose, people just like to be annoying with others, people try to do hard life for the others people.

Although Thomas Jefferson says if inactivity also serve a purpose in life, in my opinion, when you do not do anything you will never get a result of good things always we have to try to do some effort to be someone in life.

In addition, According to the prompt and ""determine never to be a idle"". I have never been idle in life, because i always do my responsibilities and i try to not be lazy, some times i also help other peoples cause we need to be good with others no matters how they are with us. I always like to do my own work because i want to be some one in the future that's why i like to do some effort in life. Everyone makes errors in life but, always we will try to fixed no matters how big they are, some day i want to my fathers be proud of my work in life. I never want to be a idle person.

In conclusion, is wonderful how we have done in life because life is so hard for everyone but, always we can do some effort to be proud of our self.

Although Thomas Jefferson believes that is always better be doing something that doing nothing, because if you do not try to do things in life you will never get a purpose, actually Thomas Jefferson says that if inactivity also serve a purpose, in my opinion people do not like to do things because they do not want to be someone in life and they are lazy.

2522;BB5B58E098AB;"Well i think we choose our own character traits,because its up to you what you want to do, we choose if we want to be happy,sad,or angry. I've learned that with my mom,she always tells me,""you choose to be happy,sad,angry""

Sometimes our character is formed by influences beyond our control,and that's okay everyone has diffrent reasons to be mad or to be sad,happy but we can change it if we want to. The British naturalism and politician John Lunnock was right about what he wrote,this helps a lot of people to understand that if someone do,did,say,or have said something to you ,it'll be our choice to get mad,sad,or just ignore what happened..

After that your character it'll be what you choose to make it.

For example,i've been trought a lot this past years ,my chilhood was not the best i did not had a father or my mom when i was a little girl,i grew up with my grandparents my uncle raped me when i was seven years old,my other unclu he used to hit me all the time in my head,my grandma used to hit me with the belt , i was fat when i was a little girl,and people used to make fun of me,

That really affect me ,because i'm unsecure about my body,or how i look,i've in Hospitals because i try to kill myself last year,because i was depressed,because all the things that i've been trought and now i choose to be happy,im going to therapits on Monday's,i started working ,i play soccer,or i go out with my sister.

I have choose to be happy .

Sometimes it's hard to be happy,even that you know you want to be happy you just don't see one reason to be,and it's sad because you know your family it's feeling the same pain you feel inside of you ,the only thing you think in those moments are, ""why would i do this"" or ""why am i trying so hard "" .

Those are the worst feelings,when you want to get up in the morning but you can't.

In conclusion,my opinion it's that everyone needs to know that ,our character will be what we choose to make ,we have to make good decisions to be good.";2;2;2;2;2;2

929;47261D6E0F08;"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something?. We accomplish excellent grades at school by studying , at sports by practicing everyday and never giving up to become an amazing player, and at work by learning and giving a lot of effort to realize our goals.

First of all, students stay after school or ask for a raise pass to study more about the subject they have a test or quiz.

In the actuality, there is a lot of schools from South America like Peru, Chile, Bolivia, etc. that do not have after school or raise pass for students to study more. Some students have to pay approximate 30 dollars per hour for a personal teacher to help them at home. Students from South America do not have the facility to study with their teachers without paying for extra classes. Another example, when I came to United States, there was a day that I had an important test, and I did not know nothing about the topic. So, I stayed after school with my teacher, and we practiced a lot. When I took the test, I answered all the questions without problem. The next day, my teacher gave me back the test and I was the highest grade of the class. That made me stayed more often at school with my teachers to study different classes. Furthermore, to get good grades, students have to do homework, projects, and participate a lot in class.

Secondly, it is important for people that want to get better at sports to practice everyday to become an excellent player.

Additionally, people success in sports, when they never give up and try to learn by their mistakes. When I was in Generic_City, at school I was part of a volleyball team, and we played against another school. That day, I was not ready to play with the other school. My team lost the game because I did not played good. I did not want to play anymore, because I was scared of losing again. But I did not give up because I was fascinated with this sport and

I kept practicing and becoming better at volleyball.

I know that the best way to success at sports is practicing all the time, and never give up in something that you love. I learned that if I stayed in inactivity, and do not practice, I would never become a good player in volleyball.

Finally, people accomplish at work when they do new projects to grow the company each day. Another reason is, people have to be responsible with their duties at work. Besides, if you want to get a higher level position, then you can do it by learning more about your job and showing your effort and hard working everyday. In this days, is hard to get a good and stable job because it requires effort and knowledge, but being active and always doing something to make a wonderful work will let you find an amazing job. By the other hand, being idle can give you bad consequences like, you can be fired, never find a job or never be successful in life.

I am sure that most people accomplish more when they study at school to get good grades, at sport when they practice and believe in themselves to become an extraordinary player, and at work when they learn and give a lot of effort to fulfill their goals.";3.5;3.5;3.5;3.5;3.5;3.5
3282;E4051C85D12E;"If we think about the words that the British Prime Minister Wiston Churchill sait "" succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" There is a lot of truth is this words well that is what I believe. So how important is the role that failure plays in the process to reach success and don't loss enthusiasm in the proccess? In my opinion it is very important because it make us gain experience, improve our skills, and it make you feel comfortable and happy at the end.

Les't think about how you feel when your staring in the proccess to reach a new goal that you propose to youself it could be hard at the begin, because is your first time in that enviroment and maybe you have none experience there, and that could make you to fail some times and could be desesperate to you.

you or people migth say, "" this is not for me,"" because you already fail a few time and you think but is just the beginc how will be the future. That could make you loss enthusiasm, but if you think what happend when you keep going with all this fails you're gaining a lot of experience during that proccess. For example, when I star to study at Generic_School it was a big change for me staring with the lenguage, because I came from a coutry of Spanish speakers and here the official lenguage is English, so I remember that in the begin my English was really poor, and I just knwe a few words in English like good morning or the name of some school's supplies, but everytime I did something wrong I learnd something new from that mistake wich make me gain experience in the proccess of my English learning. Even if sometimes is embarasing to say or spell worng a word infront of people you will be learning to do it rigth with the time. Therefore we should see the fails as a good oportunitie to gain more experience.

Most of the time you will notice some changes in yourself while you're reaching some goal, I'm talking about the change on your own skills. That could be maybe improve some skills that you already had before or in the best of the cases developing a new one. Using the last example that I used, when I star to learn English I remember that my speaking was the most hard part for me, because is hard to think a word first in Spanish and then traslate that word in to English and also spell that word correct just on your mind. Sometimes I started a sentence but then I couldn't finish it. That was so embarrassing for me, but with the time that problem has been decreased not all, but now is not like the begin. Sometimes that happend to me again when I'm doing presentation or when I'm imfront of nwe people that i have never met. But I feel that the practice has been helping me to decrease that problem and now is easier for me to speak with some body in English at school or in my job . Even if you feel bad or embarrassing to fail with the time that will help. You can be improving skills or even descoviring new ones while you fail that is part of the whole proccess of reach success.

Maybe for some people the fact of fail is the worst thing that can happend to them in the proccess to reach success some of them could say,"" You have to do perfect if you want to reach your goals,"" but I think that we can not do perfection without failure. Failure is a big and les't say importnat part of reach success. Have you ever heard the words , "" No pain, No gain,""

I like that words, because reminds me how good feels when you reach a goal in wich you speend a lot of time or maybe hard work.

For example, when you have a big test at school and you have been studing for that test all nigths for a week or even more and the day of the test you know all the anwers for that test and you got an A or A+ as a grade that feels so good and comfortable to you. Just because of your hard work you are getting all this good grades that you gain by yourself. That is one of the best sensations that you can ever feel or experiment. Using my example agin I can say that all the result of my hard work that I have done helping me to get good gains in my English developing .

Not matter howmany times you fail the last feeling is best in the world. Because is the result of all your hard work. Sometimes I remember how hard was for me to star school in a differnt country, but when I see that I'm about to garduate and get my High School diploma it reminds me all the hard work that I have done during this almost 2 years that I have studing here in Generic_School.

It could sound bad when you hear the word failure or fail when your trying to reach a goal, but if you think we should see all the forms that this words have. Success is not all about fail there is more. We have to go deeper into that words. As I said fail is a big and important part in the way to reach a goal. Success is a big proccess with branches and one of this branches is the failure. But failure give us more than we think. it give us experience that could prepare us for future problems or future goals, it also prepare or improve your skill and even if you don't have one you could descover one that you didn't notice, and finally, but no less important the comfortable feeling that give you at the end is incredible because remind you all the hard work that you have done. So I think if you don

't want to lloss enthusiasm during the proccess of reach success you shouldn""t see the word failure as it is you should go deeper in to try to understand the important role that it plays in the pursuit of success. I just mencion three reasons here but there could be more than three just don't think that just because you fail is the end of the world instead see how failure could help you to reach that important goal your or success. I hope all the time that I've fail in my English speaking will help me to in the future became in a perfect bilingual speaker having my home lenguahge Spanish and my new home lenguage English.";2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5
32;032EA4B76BF5;"Some people may think that positive attitude is not the key to success in life, but I disagree with them because I feel like now days are not the same like it used to be, and I think its a big issue that we have today in our world.

People just wanna finish their jobs very fast, and they wanna get where their going really fast,

and that leads to not have a good attitude with others, one of the first reasons is you can get to your dream job, for example if your positive with others they can like you or offer you a deal that's going to change your life for ever, and they may say that your a great person, and they might offer you to come and work in their company or work in a really great passion.

Another reason is you can make someones day or make them happy, for example their having a really bad day and you come and talk to them with a positive attitude, and maybe your going to make them really happy and also that can effect on others if you make them happy they can make others people happy also.

One last reason is Communication, for example by having a positive attitude you can communicate with others, and you can have a good relationship with them and maybe be really good friends.

In conclusion for all theses reasons i think positive attitude is the key to your success.              ";2.5;2.5;3;2.5;2.5;2.5
2528;BB8DBBD8C4AB;"I agree with this statement, because is hard to be yourself, in a world like this, where the people judge everything in your life, and you have to be how they want, they always are telling you what you have to do or what you not, and they not care about your opinion.

A example:

In my personal life is with my family, they always are telling me what I have to do, and when I do something wrong they judge me, they want to select my friends, my clothes, include my shoes, in a situation like this is difficult to be what you really what to be, and the razon is because they don't give us a chance to demostrate what we really are.

Another example is:

With the people of outside, we never are going to be how they want, if they saw you with a boy who use tattoo they think he is a bad boy, if you are a fat girl your ugly, if you are skinny girl your ugly too, if you use a mini skirt you are a creazy women. So we never will be fine.

Everybody can judge, but we have to be strong, we have to try to demostrate what we are, or what we like to do.

Razons:

We can have a lot of bad situations in this life, Maybe one day we can feel bad or sad, Because we not feel good with the people who judge, maybe we are tired to feign to be another person, or maybe we can think in a negative way. A example of this could be say ""I never do something good"", "" I am not a good person"". So we need to be what we want to be, and love yourself is the most important thing, if you not love yurself no one can love you more then you, obviously we have to know what decisions we want to take, you have to feel good with yourself, with your decisions. You have to show what you are, if you feel good you will be good.

All this are razons for which one is hard to be yourself, and is for that razon i agree with Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson, cause i feel identified with what he say; I feel a winner, i feel happy with my personality, and is because i don't care what the people say, or think about me, is my life, I take my decisions. If I am a creazy women who always is imperative but i feel good with that am fine. I like to be happy, be my self. I really love me. I don't have to feign nothing. The little girl who always was doing what the people saying is in the past not in my present. I learning to be my self, so ""Yes"" I make a greatest accomplishment in my life, and is nice to be your self, now i feel relax, and satify with my decisions, I desmostrated what I am. I have a beautiful life, and my life always is with laugh, laugh, I am creazy, and I love to be creazy, my personality is unique. and i like that, so I feel very happy.";2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5
1377;6A00BED6B62D;"Do you think it is a good idea for students to start their career such a young age and stress about it? I will tell you guys why it is not a good idea. Reason number one students can feel a lot of pressure on them. Reason number two students still do not know what them want to be yet.

Students can get a lot of pressure because students have not found out what they want to do in life. Students can get over welled so easily. Students think about it to much what they want to be when they grow up. Especially freshman they just stated school they do not need any stress when it comes to think about their career. Freshman do not what they want to be yet. They are just new kids that have just stared high school and they do not need to think about it yet. Students already have enough stress and, they do not need anymore of that. Students already have stress from school, sports, home problems, and the list can go on.

Students still do not know what them want to be yet. It is hard to find something want you like to do in life as your career such as a young age. Students may thing they have found the one that they really want to do in life but, they change their mind and, they what want to go for the other career. Therefor, students need more time to think about what they want to do in life. It takes time to think about what students what to be to grow up. There is a lot of things to do for your career so students just have not found the right one yet. They need time to make sure what they really want to do in life and they feel it is the right one.

Some might says it is a good idea for students to commit a career such a young because it will benefit them in life. Here it is were I am go to prove them wrong. Students get stress so easily and they do not need any more of that. Students do not need to feel pressured and it is okay to say that they do not know what that want to be when they grow up. It is not okay to rush students as they enter high school. Students can make their own mind when the thing it is the right time and, also they think they really think what they want to be when they grow up just give them time. To my congestion it is not a good idea for students to commit to a career as they enter high school because they need time to think about it well.";3;3;3;3;3;3
1741;83C48C5697AE;"Living in a place with frequentely hihgest demand to provide my best, is one the must important achievement. I agree with Emerson statement because with the individuality we can reach all our goals.

It is to important for me to recognize that i have to get my goals with effort. Because this help to provide, work hard, competition, and bocome the best .Individuality is a good factor to trust in my self to be the best because help us to look for option that help our lifes

.Working by my self make me work hard. when a person work by his own company he try to do a great work fixing everything it is the such as work alone, if you work alone yo going to do a perfect job to impresione others labors .For example, when i work without partner, i try to do a great gob to be one on the best workers. When i do my own work i feel excite cause, i could receive an award for be a good producer. everybody want to be award for their job so everrybody wish a reward. But to be award we have to hsave capacity in the jobs Many person due the same thing like me cause doing my the own work provide a big result. So working by my self make an emotion to work hard and to increase the amoung. Consequently to do a individual work make a good results. Doing own projects workers show more production In the factory and result good Therefore this help to get alot resources by workers.

Competiton is a ways to decrease the teamwork. individual competition is a big example of overcome. Examples could be when a person start to work in his job and start to recieve more money because the person is doing a great work ,this make that others poerson get mad so in the factory start the competition cause everyone want to recieve more money and they thick is unfair be reciving the same amoung of money so they start to argued why the manager give more money to the new guy but the thing is that he has a good specialization in the job. concecuently Many time the work competition provide a good production in the factory so, everyone want to get their goals like a good amount of products also,big accomplishment occur with the worker is trying to find a new way to get more product than other. For example, when a worker finished his assignment could receive free time,this make feel angry other workers so , they are going to try to look for others forms to produce more than the winner because, they want to receive the same reward for the production . To do a good competition the work have to be alone to and with big group people. competition is a good way for individuality work to provide a emotional affect. In many companies the owners look for a way that workers produces a lot and they offer money or free time to the person that make more products .as result, being in a factory with many labors working seperated make a big impact where everyone want to procud the most materials. Therefore,challenge could be a a good idea for separated jobs .

Looking for an accomplishment to become the best. Every one in this life want to have something to be recognize in this world althogh,to be a succefull person we have to work hard. Not matters what tell about us such as critique,bullying ,etc. The only thing that is important for us who we are. So the best thing that could can happens in our life is be a place where frecuently we are demand to do different things. Although with many problem we have to be patience and support all bad things. Because,if we wish to be different than the rest of persons and realize our goals. thought must be working by our selves. Because sometimes nobody is with us to provide help. fighting by my self i could be a big man in the socierity. Currently in the world we have many competition one example can be soccer,almost the majority look in the tv .Soccer is a game where a team have 24 for player. They have to compite who is the leader in the team. So like in the real life the leader is the person that work hard,help the other players .Otherwise, could be a leader in a company, to be the leader of a company ,the leader had to compite with other person that wanted to become a big leader ..Therefore to be a person succesfull have to take individual decision .

Being in a world where have to take decision and concern about goals is the best thing that we can have to show our capacity. Doing my own job make me put effort and dedication. Work in gruop is affect by bet. Being a different person than others. The person that different quality could be someone that can help. Because, this kind of person make the differences in the world trying to win in a place where the competition and the demand are in high level ,so they try to have imfluences in the in their jobs. The individuaity help alot in the world to be a succesful place. For example in the govermen there are many people with a big level to compite with other this, that means it i s has a great achievement in the government,so i agree with Emerson statement cause the competition provide good benifit for us and too the progress of the government,factory,countries,therefore being a part with competiton meke us to improve our best";2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5;2.5

2802;CCB5EED97986;"I do agree, attitude is energy, and without energy we are nothing.

All the time, the attitude of every single person could change radically, but that could demonstrate what kind of person who you are. Every single person who can not do their own things with attitude, is like if they're not doing it with energy.

My mom change radically her attitude when she's talking with an unknown person. My cousin is the one that teach me how to be a better person just with attitude,

because of some problem's that we have in our family, for all the things that happen in my country, and also for the death of my uncle.

I love my big brother, I want to be as him, for the things he achievement on all his life. My brother is one of the most kindness person in the world. He could talk with an angry person, and just a few minutes, he would be able to change they're mind, how can that be possible?. Its all about attitude.

It's been a while for all the moment's that I lived in my entire life. Every single night that I'm going to sleep, I think all about what I did during the whole day, and I go over to think what do I did wrong, and what do I have to change to have a awesome personality, so when people talk to me, just for the way I talk, they would know if I have a great attitude. The attitude can help people life, because when you are going to ask for a application to get an employment, if you are thinking negative things, nothing is going to be positive to you.";2.5;3;3;3;3;2.5
402;1E6F7CF7470E;"To help or make the world a better place you only need one thing, your imagination.

Imagine this, a world without people imagining things. if people don't use their imagination then half of the stuff we have now would be not here. I agree that imagination is important than knowledge, because you can imagine how your future going to be, and imagine how you can change the world.

Imagination is important because without it, how did people make the things we have now, because they use there imagination. If you imagine it hard enough it might come true. Scientist are making medicine to cure the sick, why do they do that? Because they imagined that if there was no medicine then half of they human population would die, so they make medicine. If there were no police then our world would be full of criminals and destruction so they imagined to make a police station and people became cops. You can also help out the world. If you just imagine how you are going to do that and imagine how your future is going to be if you do that. I know some of us imagine to grow up and marry a famous person, sadly imagination don't work like that, but there are many beautiful girls and boys (or puppies, if your going to be single all your life) out there. And I know you prefer someone like Emma Watson or someone else, but like I said imagination don't work like that. You can also imagine the impossible and it could happen ( but not the marriage part), if you make it happen. So I believe that imagination is more important than knowledge and I hope now, you do to.

3908;FFDC4011AC9C;"""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" What I think about that quote is that you cant do your best in every problem. If your still stuck on what it even means like I was in the first few minutes of seeing that, It means that in every challenge you see in life there is always a way to try your best and get through that challlenge, dispite what your mind tells you because your mind is your biggest enemy you will ever face. I dont particularly agree with that quote jsut because in certain problems even if you try your best you will still fail or if you just dont want to do the problem or other people around you dont then you most likley fail to. What im trying to get at to this quote is that instead of being ""For every problem there is a chance for you to do your best"" it should be ""For every problem or challenge there is always a way to get thorugh it"". Here is a few examples: If your dying from old age and your deadline is going to be this week. Then just die you get around the challlenge by dying because in most relgions there is something called heaven so you can die and go to heaven. Another example: Facing a hard question, just guess! You'll have a 1/4th chance of getting it right and if you just guess it would be bettter then sitting on the problem for 20 minutes.";2;2;2;2;2;2

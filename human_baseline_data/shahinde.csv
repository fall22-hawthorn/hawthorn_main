2600,C0EAFCE50675,"I agree with Thomas Jefferson about accomplishing myself every time i do something, i think if we always woke hard or at least be with the mentality to work we will always get stuff done without even thinking about it. Most people realize how they can get there work done when they are actually doing something. You can do anything if you really think like Thomas Jefferson, Just like most of the people say '' Work hard to be succeful

'' if you never do nothing you will never finish what you have to do. Just think about how much people wanna be the same thing we wanna be , if you really wanna be succesful you have to work and you will always get stuff done.

Most people dont be active all the time and they take advantage of technology because now days technology can do everything. Nobody have any excuse for no finishing work. we live in a world where if u be smart doing what u suppose to do you will get it ''DONE''. One good example is:The president just think how much work he have to get done to make a country look good,no problems,etc.

It really is wonderful how much work can we finish if we always doing theres no excuse for not doing work Just like i said i think that everybody who work a lot they gonna accomplish more every time they doing something and think how fast they did it just because you are not thinking about how much work you have to get done and never think inactivity also serve a purpose because if u dont do nothing you will not be the person you always think about or goals you have in mind, Every goal or career you wanna do takes time and time goes fast so you have to take advantage of everything and make sure you always doing what you suppose to do and not wasting your time saying i will do it next time because theres no next time.

3407,EA105A8B8699,"I agree because in life you can achieve many goals and pass through so many good things like me i always think positive thats why so many good things happen to me also never disagree because in life you never know what could actually really happen maybe something bad that you have no clue about . Life is great if you keep a positive attitude for example give people advice on somethig good maybe one day they will do the same for you be greatfull with what you have or get beacsue soem people dont have what you have and they really want . Thats why i always have a postive attitude beacuse when i make good discissions i get what i want.

Here are some examples of why you shoud agree for example you get a job a costumer comes by needs help you give them a positive attitude they will give you a positive attitude to help eachother out give them respect talk to them nicely you never know something good could happen second of all what could happen if you give them a bad attitude they will give you the same attitude to. Look at the bright side what happens when you them a positive attitude and they give you a bad attitude you keep the same attitude no matter what they will see and think to their head wow he or she has a nice attitude while the perrson is giving them and ungreatfull attitude.

Always be the bigger person with great attitude even if the person is having a bad day probably try to give them a positive attitude and probably you might cheer them up its always good to make people feel good about themselves afterwards you will feel good because you helped them out . Its never a bad thing to have a positive attitude because good things will come to you .",3,2.7,2.5,3,2,2
2405,B2D03F892B0D,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

In my position I think it's a great idea to attend classes from home only if you work, or if you can handle any type of work by yourself without a person that will persuade you to do the work, and if you know English perfect.

I think that some students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because for some students it's difficult to wake up early because some students who work on

Part-times, and some students don't want to wake up early, or they go to bed late for playing games on their phones.

Secondly. I think that some students might benefit from this program if they can handle any type of work independently without a teacher or any person persuading them to do the work, because some students are smart and they like to work independently, in silence, without people disturbing thems or without too much explanations.

Also. I think that the only students that can understand any work and can only attend classes from home, are those who knows English Perfect, because if you know English perfect then you can work in any topic or subject without the help of anybody, If you are a Hispanic born in other country then this program it can work for some Hispanic students because they are used to get everything easy, to get what they want without making a effort.

In the other hand, I think that this program it won't help to those students who distract easy or those who don't do work without any person who will persuade them to do the work, because there are students who likes everything easy, students who don't want to make an effort, this program it won't work to those students who don't like to study, to those who have only F on their classes or those who are skipping, or not going to school.

In conclusion I think this program can only help those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person. and for those students who have dreams, those who makes a effort to get what it can help thems in the future, for those that knows that life it's not easy, to those students that know that if you don't work for it you won't get what you want on life. those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person.",3.5,3.5,3.2,3,3.7,3.2
2131,9F7E189A2DCF,"Do you believe to know a person through one impression? Some people believe that most of the people's personality will depends on their presentation or the way that dress up, they think that your knowledge or your personality is base on how you look. I believe that the first Impression could change for the following three reasons; Your clothes or how you look do not show your type of personality, the kind of person who you are will depends on knowing the person and through knowing the person your idea about the person could change.

The majority of people classify the type of person base on how they look, What I believe is that your clothes and how your look do not say or show your type of personality or the kind of person who you really are.

Base on my short experience to know a person takes time and the first impression could be unfavorable in strong relationships or friendships that's why I believe that who you are will depends on knowing the what kind of person you are.

Most of the strong friendships or relationships that I know they were enemies or they did have a good impression about the person at first time but through the time they had the privilege to know the person and they found a good kind of person.

To conclude the first impression is good way to present ourselves but through knowing the person we will find that the first impression does not care when knew the kind of person that's why I believe that first impression could change through knowing that person.",4,3.8,3.7,3.5,4,3.5
538,293A93F037A7,"I agree with Winston Churchhill because without failure how can we be succesfull in life. Frist, reason why because If you fail at something you can reflect on it. Second, failure can make you become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. Third, Is never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success.

You can always reflect on somthing you fail at, and become better. If, you don't study yourself at something you failed at, then you can't become successfull. For example, say you were playing a football game, and you missed your tackle in the game. After the game you watch the film, and see what mistakes you did wrong. After you seen what was wrong in film. You studied the film, and trian harder in practice for next game, so that won't happen again. Another reason you can do after you reflect on yourslef is practicing at something you love to do. For example, riding a bike for the frist time without trianing wheels. If you fail at riding a bike, then you have to practice, so you can become better at it. In order to practice you have to reflect on it frist. After you reflect what you did wrong, then you will become better when you practice.

Failure can teach you to become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. For example, you went to practice for a 100 meter, but you did not wram up at all. You decided to run the 100 meter for the frist time anyway. After you finsh the 100 meter you didn't feel good about the time you had. The next day you decide to warm up, and work harder to get better results. After your trianing you wanted to run a 100 meter. When you ran a 100 meter you felt better with your time, and decided to work harder everyday to become better then you were yesterday. This is how failure is making you better because it is teaching you that if you fail at something, you can always pick it back up, and become better, then what you were doing that day when you failed at something. If you want to become better, then you were yesterday. Then don't worry about the past because thinking about it all the time will bring you back to failure. For example, say you are mad that you lost your 100 meter race in fourth place. When you lost, you keep thinking about it all the time, and can't move forward for the next race. When the next race starts the day after you lost. You lost the race again in fourth place because you keep thinking about the race you lost in the past, then thinking about how can you can become better then you were yesterday. The point is in order to become better you have to think how can you improve better for the future, then thinking about how you failed in the past.

Never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. For example, say you have a math test on Monday, but you decide on Sunday to not study for it because you think the test is very easy. On Monday you give up on a math test, and decide to fail it. The reason why because you did not study, and it was too hard for you. You decide to retake it on tuesday, and learn from your mistakes. On Tuesday after you failed the math test. You took the test again to get a better score because you studied very hard to succesed in the test. This is why you always use failure to lead you to success. If you let failure consume you, then you won't reach to the top to become successful. For example, you can't swim at all, and your drowing. For some reason you dont won't to reach the top because you are depressed, and want to give up.

In conclusion, I still believe It is impossible to be succesfull without failure. Without failure we cannot reach the top to be successful. Without failure we cannot reflect on things to become better. Without failure we cannot become better then yesterday. In order to become successful we have to use failure to lead us to success. Its okay to fail because after you learn from it. Everything is going to be okay when you overcome it, and be better.",3.2,2.7,2.5,3,2.3,2.5
1829,89C7C4115B84,"One place that i really want to go is Generic_City, Italy. i really want to go here mainly because of the stuff i can do their. I really want to see the fancy cars that Italy make's like the Lamborghini or the Ferrari an the Alpha Romero or other car that i normally dont see here were i live. I also want to know more about their culture. i wan to learn their language i want to eat their food i want to know how they live if ts ruff or easy or even both. I really want to eat the real Italian food! i always wanted to see if their would be a difference. One other main reason i want to come is for the tours, i want to get on the cannou then paddle and ride the whole channel.

The reason why i really wan to see the fancy cars is because i have a big thing for cars. Ever since i was a little kid my dad will always talk about cars and i'll always be with him ill play with toy cars and and when ever i see i nice car i always call it out saying ""thats my mustang gt"" or ""thats my supra"". My cousin always modifies if cars (he's also a car guy) he's another reason why i like cars. He has a Rx-7 every single part is modified he spend more money on his car then he does of him self. When i grow up i'm going to be a car guy like him. Another reason why i want to go to Italy to see the cars is because were i live you would see a Ferrari like once every 1-2 years and over in Italy seeing a Lamborghini must be like seeing a mustang. so that is why i want to see the luxury cars.

I really want to know how their culture is. i want to know how life is over their i want to see if their kind or mean. i want to learn their language so i can talk with them. To me learning their language or understand it will be an easy thing to do. I think it will be easy because Italian and Spanish language is closely the same. I just don't want to be in on part of the country i also want to go to other places because i know that their are different cultures around the country.

I mainly want to try the real Italian food i dont want to be eating the American version of Italian food. I want to see if their a difference of the the foods i want to know witch one tastes better or if they taste the same. thats what i want to know about their culture.

Another thing that i want to do over their is go in tours. i want to go on tours because when i see on the TV shows, movies, and commercials i always say ""im tryna go their!"". I also want to go to tours over their because i can see the cultures and how places look their. When i go on tour i find out stuff that i didn't know about and finding about new thing is good for your brain. I also always wanted to go to the cannel waters and ride. ever since i was a little kid i would see that people would ride on the cannel waters.

This is why i want to go to Generic_City, Italy. because of all off these fun stuff i can do their. All of these are reasons why i want to go to Generic_City, Italy. I hope one day i can go to Italy and explore their.",3.2,3,2.2,2.9,2,2
3889,FF4CBDA0E418,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. In my opinion first impression might be possible to change because people are different human with different habits and it depends on ourselves how we act and treat the person that we want to impress.

For example Generic_Name wanted to apply for a job in a clothing company named Dior which is a popular,expensive,and fancy brand he prepares himself for his first interview,he wears black suit and black shoes and starts heading to the office with his CV he have enough expeirence to be one of the employer in the company he impress his boss and thats how he gets his job.

In addition to this statement the reason why the first impression is impossible is because the people did not met each other more than once they do not know their habits what they like about each other or what they do in their daily life or what they like to do like their expeirence.

In conclusion I would say this statement is kind of equal disagree or agree becuase like I said people never know each other habits and what they like for example: what is their hobby, what they eat,what they like to wear, so at the end my opinion is I am disagree with this statement.

1123,570595740274,"Do students need summer break or they can handle not have summer but with more breaks around the year?

Students need summer break because students like summer more than other other times in the year because is hot outside and it doesn't snow all the day also, during break some students can do things that they couldn't do because of the school. For example have a job, just enjoy and relax outside with family and friends or have big families plans that they were expected, students have more odds to do all that in summer because.

They can put all their effort in their jobs. almost all the students that I know have summer job in fact I actually have two summer jobs. For students have a summer job is actually very important and it means a lot because it can be the first thing that they actually put all their effort, and is not only the fact that they put all their effort it can be the fact that they can be helping their family for example.

Their mom is having a bad time at work, the sells went down, is being two weeks since the last buyer went to the store, is not something new at the store that could bring buyer, and is being a bad moth for their mom, their son will try to help her paying small things like the internet, the water, the light or he could actually do his best, paying all that and paying the rent of the house, some teenagers not only work in summer for their own good some teenager work for help their family with everything they can however. Sometimes they need relax, doing nothing or going out to eat, watch a movie with friends or family, or go to party with your friends and enjoy summer how I said, I have two summer jobs.

The first one is in construction and the second one is in a place called Generic_Name. My first week doing all that I feel tired and I feel that I couldn't do all that anymore but I realize that my family needed me and I keep doing it, in my first work I actually learn a lot about how to measure things and how to use a electric hammer also my boss is my uncle so I spend good time with him and I meet some really nice people. The second one is in Generic_Name I had to take care of kids, clean the place and make food, I meet really nice people there that helped me a lot and I realize that I like work with kids. However some students don't have a summer job and that is fine, some students likely have some family plans or plan with their friends that they want to do for summer like.

Go some to another country with you parents, sometimes parents have vacations at the same time that summer start if they change the vacations it will interfere with the time that students spend with their parents. Some students actually don't spend a lot time with their parents in fact I am one of those. our parents work to 8 AM to 8 PM and when they come back they are tired and they just wanna eat and go to sleep, and we understand why they are like that. In summer we spend time with out parents we go out to eat, we go to the movies or we go in a travel to another country that is the first reason why student prefer the vacations in summer than in another time of the year the second reason can be.

because of the sun, we all have to accept that we get tired of the cold, rain, snow and frozen rain we all get tired, and we want the sun also with the sun your garden won't die or it wont look ugly. Sometimes when we have summer some times another school from another country or another state have summer that means they could come here or we could go there and spend time with them. I actually have some friends from Venezuela and every time they have summer they come here to spend summer with me however.

Yeah sometimes it can be hard retain information but students need rest for while, spend time with their families and friends, and if they want it or they need it get a job and do their best.

Can they change vacations for another day or just have more different vacations but not that long?

No summer is not only the time where students rest, also is the time when they spend time with their parents or friends, it can be the time for some students to work and help their family.",1.8,3,2.8,3,3.2,3
3352,E7EBDBDD703F,"Do curfews keep teenagers from getting into trouble? The city council is still currently debating on either adopting the curfew to be at 10 p. m. during the week days or at midnight on the weekends. If teenagers were to be out after the hours selected, it would be considered breaking the law. The laws are choosen for many reasons, even if we don't agree with most of them; we have to obey the laws. I believe the city council should adopt the cerfew for the minnors. When it comes to under age people in this world we have to be more conserned for their safety, it is best to have curfews. We should consider all the dangerous things going on in this world.

Have you considered all the things that could happen when your child is out? There is many dangerous things going on in this world. I'm not saying something will happen but honestly nowadays anything could happen. Without an adults care vision many things could occur. Many minnors are being killed or harmed for reasons we don't know. A curfew is one way from preventing those things from happening to your children. Even though a curfew at midnight on a weekend could still be dangerous; it is our responsability to teach the minnors from right to wrong. If we get them to understand why it is important to have a curfew they would be exrta careful. Theres a high possability they won't want to listen about their curfew; I can speak for myself I would want to spend more time with my friends there was a few times I didn't listen to my mom. I relized how much my safety ment to my mother and how worried she would be when i would be out late.

Have you heard about what happened to Generic_Name in New York? He was such a good child. His mother talk about how he loved hanging out with his nephews and family. She said he wouldn't go out with friends, he would always be home. He was very close to his sister, they'd always be together. Generic_Name had good grades in school, he would never get into trouble at all. The reason I bring his story life into this essay is because he was killed a few blocks away from is house, outside a little food market. I'm not so sure about the time but it was after dark. It was a group of guys who saw him, dragged him out the market and stabbed him under his arm. He tryed asking for help but no one would help him; he tryed getting to a hospital by foot unfortunaly Generic_Name didn't make it and died on the sidewalk. Those guy were caught a few months later and said they confused him with another guy. Generic_Name had no fault in any of it,he didn't deserve it. Maybe if he would of wanted for the next day or if his mom would of took him things could of happened diffrently. My point is leaving your house alone isn't so safe, when your with your parents it goes completey different.

Some people might think they would give the freedom they wanted as a child to there children. They might think there isn't a problem with them going out when ever they'd like and don't think they need a curfew. Everyone wants to enjoy their life and live it fully. Enjoying life doen't have to be passed your curfew, theres more to see during the day. Yes, you might trust your child so much you believe it's okay for them to leave but do you believe in the other people with your child being out in pulic? During day is much more safe then at night time when it's dark. One reason being is because of how many peolpe are out during the day. You could scream for help, run or give signs of being in danger. At night everyone is sleeping, and barely anyone is around.

In conclusion, the city council should think about the things going on in this world and do what's best for the teenagers, which is to have a curfew. Teenagers can still have their freedom and enjoy every bit of their lifes with curfews. I think it would be for the best; everyone would be safe in that way. Mostly everyone can agree that their minnors safety is important. Curfews would also keep teenagers from getting into trouble.",3.2,3.4,3,3.8,3,3.5
2804,CCDD77656701,"Do you thing that most danger of us lies not setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark? Sometimes is not good to tell others what you want because some of them may not want good things for you to get or have, you want to not used too much you phone, you want to loose some weight, and you want to graduated from high school.

Today in day many people used their phone a lot and sometimes they don't do things because they spend most of their time on their phones. For example, you get home from school and you have to do some homework, but you don't want to do it yet because you just got home from school, and you tell your self that you will relax for a few hours, and then you will start to do your homework. You ate dinner and everything you go to your room and one of your friends ask you if you want to play videos game? you tell your self I will play a little bit and then I will start to do my homework. Two hours pass by and you are still playing videos games. You tell your friend I must stop playing because I have to start doing my homework and your friend tells you don't go, we ask someone to give us copy, and you say yes, because you want to continue do keep playing. When you get to school you don't have any body to ask to give you copy. It was your choice to keep playing. That day you make a plant you put a timer and when that timer stop you will stop doing what you are doing. It work because when you time your self you can do more than one thing, you could also have more time to just play but the good thing is you have finish all you things.

For new year resolution you say that you will loose some weight this year. Your family laugh at you because you had said that almost every year and you have not do it. Sometimes is good to just tell your self to do things and don't tell anyone because some people don't want others to get things because they want to get it first and if they don't get it. Those kind of people don't want others do get it also. If you want to loose weight just do it and don't tell any body because you don't know what others want for you. It's better to do things in secret because at the end you are the one you are doing it and no body is helping you. The things that you do are for you not for everyone. When you have your things you can tell to your closer people and some of them may be happy for you and some may not, but that doesn't have to worry you because you have already do your thing and they can't do nothing to take that away from you. Your family may see you that you say things but you don't do it. You have to show them that you can do things that you say. You may feel sad because of what people say and you just have that in your mint. That is why not good to tell everyone of what you want to do because they may be jealous and they don't want you to be in a very good shape. Just go and workout and when they see you again they will say wow you look different what did you did to look great; they will not see you as a lair because you show them that you can do things. It can take time to see the different but you are doing it.

When you are in school you will have friends that are good for you and also those that are not. When you are in high school you want to pass all your classes so you can make your parents proud and they can be happy; but their will be some friends that will tell you to go out and have fun etc. In school their will be students that care about classes and their will be that they don't care. You want to be with those friends that help each other to have good grades. Their will be friends that don't like you and want to get you in some trouble, and they will want you to don't have good grade and be like them. You want to be with friends that support each other. Also you don't want to be that kind of person that say you have good grade and you don't have those good grades and you just are copying others and when it's test time you don't know what to do because you didn't do the work by your self. To get things that you want; you have to work for it. It's better to have friends that help each other and that also that help you to do your work and can be easy for you to also help others.

People may disagree with this because they have good people around them and that they help each other. They may say this because they haven't go through things like; one of your friends don't like you and they don't want you to have the things you want. Sometimes is better to do things and don't tell everyone because you don't know what people really want for you or what they think of the things you want. In this world are people that they don't care what you, they will agreed with what you do and if you felt they always be with you, their is those that they don't want you and others to be happy. The best thing to do is just do things and when you have it tell to everyone that you want because when you already have it they can just talk bad things of you and you don't stay in front of them as a looser because you didn't they don't know how you did it. Us human been we always have the thing inside of us that always make us jealous for what others have. For example, If one of your friends have a news phone you will get a little bit jealous because you also want to have that phone. Every single person in this world has when through that. That's why people don't trust each others.

It's better to do things that no body know because if you felt or don't get what you want, their will not be people that knew. You didn't get it and they will not be talking bad things of you or look at you as a looser that you can't do anything. You will be the only one that will know and if you want to tell them you can it will be your choice. You want to do things because you want to be proud of yourself and that is the only thing it counts.",3,3.5,3.4,3.2,3.7,3.7
551,2A2AE5FB899F,"One topic that is frequently debated today is, if the amount of work days should change to less then five days to four with the idea of conserve energy and resources. Many people think the school should reduce the day of school. Some people believe that is a good idea to conserve this value and important resources. I think this idea will not make a good change because many student will be affected with this idea they work after school, we will have less time to do wherever we want, and it is difficult to everybody to stay focus ten hours in the school.

To being,

just imagine all the students how work after school, everyone have a limit in our body's and mind's to do different activities every single day. If for the students how they don't work after school it is really difficult to stay on time with they homework, think about the student's that only get home and just change their cloths, maybe eat something at home or just wait for a break in the work. A lot of students have to pay their own food, clothes, and even a lot of them pay rent. If the school finish at six, they will have less time to make money to live, that is one of the big situations that a lot of teenagers live every day. Now think about the increment of the time in the school and all the effects that will have.

Therefore, our second reason is we will have less time to do wherever we want or wherever we need to do. If the school finish at six only in one hour or more, the night come out. If you want to play soccer on the grass you can't because is to dark, a lot of stores close early, if you want to buy something you couldn't because probably the stores are closed at that time. when we got home our parents probably are not even there, many of them have to work on night. we only will have four hour's to do at less something that we want to do or we need to do starting from six to teen with the idea of that is the time to go to sleep.

However, it is difficult to stay focus ten hours in the school. More time in the school, more time of homework or even more classes to take. We will have even less time to do any activity after school, because we will not have enough time to finish our work. With all the material that we have to finish we being to stress out and not doing good in the school.

In conclusion, the amount of day at school is not necessary to change to less them five days and steel the same time, everyone get tired and sometime everyone only need a rest to continue day by day. We can fiend better ways to conserves this values resources, reduce the time of work and school will not make a big change. what about all the companies that only want to make money and they don't even care about the resources in our planet just keep doing money and destruction. sleep well if one of the most important needs of our body. If we have less time in the afternoon to do ,what we need to do we will not go to sleep early. We can't follow the same routine every single day, after school we can: play soccer, go to shopping, go to the movies. A lot of different activities that we can do, like one famous quote say "" It is more time,then life "" . We could do better with more time on our hands.               ",3.2,3.5,3.7,3.5,3.4,3.4
1732,8311ABD30CC1,"Many people thinks that the school should not follow this model by extending the school two hours. Students, teachers, and others employees have responsibilities in their houses and others places after school. Also, fathers can get a bad attitude about why theirs kids need to be ten hours at the school. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

First, some fathers believe that extending the school by two hours their kids will get more stressed. For example, extending the school by two hours students will need to do more homework, test, and projects. Students can feel like they can not do all of the work what the teacher give to them. A lot fathers doesn't have a good transportation for can pick up their kids at the school that late. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending the schools by two hours.

Second, some students have responsibilities after school. For example, some of them have sports, drama classes, and jobs. Extending the school for two hours can cause that these students can lost their jobs or some hours, they can not go to drama classes, and can not go the their sports practices. For other way, students need to have some rest of all. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

For instant, extending schools for two hours and four-day school, students can have three days free. Students can have more free time, they can hangout more with their friends, and they can have more rest. Consequently, with four-day school and extending for two hours students can get more stress, and their grade can go down. Schools should not follow this model by extending school for two hours.

Extending school for two hours, will cause that fathers will get a bad attitude, and some students will lost their jobs, sport practice, etc. Students will feel like they can not do it, and their grade will go down. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending school two hours.    ",3.5,3.4,3.6,3.2,3.5,3.5
2282,AA9B263544A9,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? In my opinion, I dont think the students would benefit taking classes at the comfort of their homes. That is because it's not the same thing as going to school. Taking classes at home is not the same as taking classes in school because in school you have a teacher that can help you, if you don't understand what's going on in the class. Also another reason is that in school you have a teacher that can teach the student actual lessons that the student can benefit from. Third reason is because sometimes you will just be lazy and not do the work and just do whatever you want since you're at home. No one will stop you, or give you remainders to do your work. Overall, I don't think the students would benefit from taking classes at their homes.

I would think that online classes would be harder and difficult to understand. In fact, being in a normal class you learn more and you are all catched up with your work. Being in school will help you communicate more with others, you can make or meet some new friends,the teacher will help you with some work if you need it. Online classes are harder because the student might not know what to do and he/she will be lost. Some people might find that online classes are hard and some might not it just depends on the individual. Some people just learn differently.

In conclusion everyone is different. What might work for you, might not work for the next person. Some people might benefit from talking online and some might not it. Honestly it just depends on what the students perfers online classes or school classes. I think that taking class in school is way better, teachers help you, you get better knowledge, you communicate more with others. Overall there is no right or wrong you just pick what you learn best and just do it.              ",3.4,3,3.2,3,3.4,3.5
2555,BDF13939FA26,"Students may say inactivity is the way to go, However other student say keeping yourself occupied will lead you towards achievement. But staying occupied is the way to go if you wanna be successful and achieve things in life. Sitting around and doing nothing wont lead you to anything sucessful in life.

If your at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. To be productive or to do something productive really does'nt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community.

Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. which means you are more likely to procasanate. On the other hand if your used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procasanate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work.

From my own expierence, when i was 14-15 years old i wouldnt do anything at home or at school which caused me to do negative things that didnt lead me to achieve my goals at that moment. Now that im 17 years old i keep myself busy by doing school work or working my part time job, which wont cause a negative effect on me because im preparing myself for my future and life goals.

Overall students think that doing nothing is the way to go, but other students say that keeping themselves occupied leads them to a succeful and positve life.

Now a days i can tell that teenagers that have been getting into legal trouble really dont have anything to do outside of school. While other teenagers actually do outdoor and indoor activtiy to keep themselves out of trouble.",3.2,3.4,3,2.9,3.4,3.3

2310,AC3111702C95,"First impressions are always important and can really effect how you are looked at but they are not impossible to change. They impact whether you get the job, make that friend or even if you get service if you are somewhere. I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change, they are hard but not impossible. Firstly, because someone could always forget, people can change, and you could receive a second chance to redeem yourself.

I have met people a second time that either I had a bad first impression with or they did and we forgot all about it. When you forget about somebody, the first impression with obviously not matter. You will forgive and forget. Also when I say the word ""forget,"" I do not mean completely lose all knowledge of the other person, but I mean maybe you did not care or maybe the first impression was not terrible that it was easy to block from your memory.

I have changed and many people in my life have also changed. Your first impression or somebody else's first impression might change if you meet them again in five to ten years. Over a period of time if let's say somebody who had a bad job interview wants to change and really wants the job, they will change and they will ask for another opportunity. Even if you have a bad encounter with someone the five times you have met them, your opinion about them will change with just one good impression. People change and when they do, so do impressions.

Second chances are also very important with impressions. Redeeming themselves is something a lot of people tend to do. Chances are not hard to ask for, and when making it up to somebody for a bad impression, you need to make it count. I have asked several people for second chances to redeem myself for bad impressions and now, we are friends. When I first applied to my first job, I was late to my interview and that is why I did not get the job. Then I asked my boss for a second chance, he gave it to me and now I have an amazing job.

In conclusion, no, first impressions are not impossible to change because there is forgetful people, people change and second chances exist. It is not hard to be on your best behavior or to be well dressed when meeting someone new, especially if they are of higher authority. First impressions are not impossible but are difficult to change, that is why it is good to try and make a good first impression to save you from trouble.",3.9,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,4

Dear Generic_Name

I write to teacher Generic_Name today with the benefit of work in group. The work in group is more better then work alone, in the beneficial is the student work in group is have more opportunity of learn more with other students in the class, they can work more better and understand more quickly the theme in the class and have more collaboration, learn to respect other students. They in the group can say new ideas for the team.

I think in the personal the work in group is more productivity in the student because have a good communication with the students and teacher, they have more positive attitude in the ideas and participation.

For example, students in the group work more and learn more quickly because in group have a higher quality of ideas, and students can change ideas together about the theme in the class and have a better determination in the job of the class.

Second, work in group have a big benefit in the class because students understand problems more quickly, and they have solution in theme complicated with ideas and dedication in class.

Third, students have collaboration with other students have a good relation and learn to respect others person for religion or ideas. They have more communication in the class and have more better grade in the school.

However, work alone not have good result because almost all the student have fear to say ideas for the critic of other students in the class, and they have slow work in the class for complication of the theme.

The preference is work with a group have more benefit in the student and teacher to learn and teach other students in the school have more communication, better work and good relation in the school.

sincerely

3077,DAD01CB5C8D8,"I'm not against having the after school homework club. I'm not against it because some people are failing their classes especially me and i would want to go to an after school homework club because one it would be helpful, two sometimes I forget that I have homework, and three sometimes I just want to get it over with and be done with the homework.

One of my reasons that I'm not against the after school club is because the students can get there grades up and have more practice when you take any test that you don't know about. For my opinion I would like to have this club because some teachers go really fast when there teaching and I can't catch up to them and it's really difficult for me. Some of the students don't know what the teacher is teaching about because maybe the subject there learning is there weakest strength to learn about.

My second reason is that students need this class because they want to achieve in life. Maybe someone wants to go to college to learn about photography but the school they want to go to is too expensive to afford like for example they want to go to a well good college but it's to expensive but the person who wants to be a photographer needs to apply for a scholarship that means they need to have good grades, participate in after school activity and much more this is why students like me need to have a after school homework club.

My third reason is that some students don't do there homework because they forgot it at school or they don't remember they have homework. People like me don't like doing homework because it's really difficult and sometimes I need help doing my homework and it would help me have in my school a after school homework club because that would be helpful to me and other students.",3.2,3.6,3.6,3.3,3.5,3.2
1011,4DB99E2F46E3,"Yes. Having a positive attitude helps you alout to be a succesful person in life. It helps you to be a parent, coatch,teacher,and friend....ect

Positive atitude is one of the basic rules that all employees follow such as a waeter or cashier. They learned it to win the customer and to get the business seccessful. When i worked in Krespy Kreem my manager tought me something which is a way to win the customer with a positive attitude that i have to follow. the service called ""the sweet"" service this word stand for smile,welcome,entice,engage,and thank. Having a positive attitude help you to beacame a friend and close to people and people will alwys feel confortable to talk to you. But having a negative attitude will make poeple fell unsafe around you and you will be lonely and not welcomed to the most of people.

Having a positive attitude also help you to be a teacher because you will always motivate your students and provide for them education. The reason why students skip classes is because of the teacher's attitude. students prefer the teacher who give a friendly smile. Positive attitude helps me alout to be an successful athlet because my coach is always happy from the way i act and my leadership that i do infront of my teamates. It makes me a respectful person and trustful guy.

In fact attitude is the way the person present his/her personality. People with a negative attitude are mostly asocial and introverts.

In my opinion having a positive attitude helps you to be a parent because the childrens get scared from the person who's always angry and frustrated. that's why most of the parents hide thier nerves and they act nicely infront of the child. Couple relationship consider attitude because most of momen prefer the guy with a positive view and who's open for evryone. The best way to live your life and be polite all the time is to have a positive attitude most poeple respect the person who give a smile and greet them. One of the importance of good attitude is bieng a family member. My uncle is the type of person who communicate and discuss with evryone and the way he talk is likeable from evryone because his always friendly and welcomed from poeple.

Politicians with positive attitude are always persuasive because they use communication skills to convince the audience by telling thier speech. Attitude is a way to find a job because when the person get an enterview with a manger he has to answer the question kindly and with a respectful way. One of the reasons of bieng a good student is acting with a positive attitude infront of my classmate.

I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life becuase its the way to live with poeple and find a job and create a family. ",3.2,3,3.3,3.2,3,3
3441,EBF9131A638F,"Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference. Schools have brought distance learning in their system for students can do their assignments from home. Many people think this is a great idea and some oppose to this learning method. The schools can see if they are on track or online to their classes but if they arn't in the online class they will be behind in their assignments. Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student?

The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosen't feel like doing it. Students who don't do their assignments they wait until they are at school because in school you arn't distracted like at home you are concentrated and ready to work. Is distance learning beneficial for students at home? for some students it might be but for many it isn't.

Is online learning at home beneficial for students? some students do think its beneficial and a really great idea. Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they don't get the question that is being asked. Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task. Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. Distance learning isn't capable of doing what you do in a classroom. Is distance learning really beneficial?

Is being taught in a classroom more beneficial for students? many students prefer being taught by a teacher than online. Students are more productive and they share their thoughts and explanations in that specific assignment than online classroom. All the students are in the same page and all gathering more information by writing notes and being concentrated in their tasks. Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers.

Students have their own way of learning, it doesn't matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesn't matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you. The students who prefer distance learning really do it at home and feel like they are learning mush more at than in a classroom. Students who enjoy learning in a classroom like being around peers and want knowledge from everyone around them. They are both beneficial for that specific student.     ",3.2,3.4,3,3.3,3.5,3.5

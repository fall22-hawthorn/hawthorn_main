318,1721F085F81E,"I disagree with this statement because your first impressions of someone or something can change overtime. When you first meet someone you automatically get an impression of that person from the way they dress, or the way they speak basically the way they do things.

Now a days people jump into conclusions, they never met the person, they just go off upon looks. For example say a teenager is wearing all black with ripped jeans and they got their pants down low, adults are going to think that teen is possible a gangster or a thug but thats not the case, thats just the style now a days.

First impression can change overtime, once you get used to something your mindset changes, say you meet a friend and you guys start talking and your friends starts giving you an attitude, your going to assume that your friend doesn't like you so you keep that mindset. Yall start talking again and this time it's going way better, you and your friend are laughing, overall just having a good time now your opinion has changed towards the person.

there was this guy he started to stare at me every few seconds so i thought he had a problem or something but he looked familiar but i couldn't figure out where i've seen him from, later that day he ended up being in my last block class, the teacher made the class work in pairs so i got up and asked the guy if he wanted to be my partner, he said sure and we began working, we started talking about random things until he said ""you look familar"" then he said didn't we go to the same middle school together, then it clicked I was friends with this guy back in middle school and haven't seen him in a long time, after that day we began talking almost everyday.

The first impressions aren't always impossible to change, you learn to change your mind overtime and start accepting things for what it is.          ",3.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,3

If I had to choose a place to visit i would choose Brazil. I would go to Brazil to learn and expertise many new things. I could learn how to speak Portuguese, I can find out how Brazilian food is or i could even learn how to make it. I would even go and see one of the famous parades held in Brazil, one of my friends went to Brazil to see the parade and he said ""It was beautiful."" Going to Brazil would be great.

Depending on the way people are raised they may change their behavior over time. If you are brave enough you can choose who you want to be, and you can guide yourself. Everyone is going trough something at this moment, and these are not always good things. People may experiment terrible incidents that are going to change their life forever.

These events are just going trough your life, and sometimes there is nothing you can do to make it different. All these things may change you character behavior. Anyone's personality is going to change if they are not aware of what they are doing, and these actions will lead you to live horrible moments. At this point you no longer have control over your actions and just doing what you want, maybe not knowing what your character has turned into.

On the other hand; will realize what is going on around their live as they grow up, and they are not afraid to know what is happening, they will use this problems to become stronger. As time passes; they will go trough different issues, experiment different changes, but they just don't pay attention to it, and do what they want. Those people usually have control over their life and decide whether they want to change or not. A lot of people around them will try to hurt make them feel different.

For some people is easy to just not care about anything and just care about themselves, it could be a good thing because not anyone is going to make you feel bad. Over time they become smarter, stronger and tougher, but they also know if they need to change something in their life. They were just raised in a different way and a different place that is why they will act different to the rest of people because they also know what is best for them, when something bad is happening they know how to handle it.

These situations may change anybodies personality and eventually they will become a complete new different person. it just depends on the actions they choose to do and the way they see the world. it could be because of tragedies, maybe many bad people around them, they could change if they wanted to. There is many possibilities and reasons for people to change and it will happen at any given point and when they realize it, they are completely different.

It just depends on the way of your thinking, only you can decide if you want to be different, some people may have a weak or strong mind. Some situations are just defined as drastic events that could happen to you and there is nothing you can do about it if you wanted to make it better, only you know if you can handle it.

2525,BB8064D7B327,"My friend is home schooled because she use to get bullied a lot so she wanted to drop out, she could'nt deal with it anymore. Her counselor gave her a better option taking online classes because she had very good grades and she wanted her to graduate and have a good future. In some schools they offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think getting home schooled is a good benefit for students who have situations at school, for student drop outs, and it's easier and quicker.

The primary reason on why it's a good benefit, it's that it helps you if you have bad situations at school such as you always get into fights with other students, you are getting harassed or bullied, you have problems with your teachers, or you think you're wasting your time and you could be working and getting money. Having online classes can help you stay out of trouble or helps you stop what ever you are dealing with. Not only it stops the situation but can help you improve and graduating with no problem. If you are having problems talk to your counselor and ask for a possibility for online classes or your parents if you can get home schooled.

Secondly, it benefits the students who are dropping out of school. Most of the students who are dropping out are for financial reasons like, they want to help there family so, they drop out and start working or some teens get pregnant at a young age and there parents most likely they dont support them or help them in anything that they need so, it causes them to drop out. It helps them further there knowledge and can possibly get a better job. It makes them feel happy knowing they can finish school because they know they already making a decision by dropping out but they can still graduate by taking online classes. I remember when i was at student counseling aide and one day a student came to ask me where should he leave his laptop because he was planning to drop out, he looked upset. Generic_Name ask him why? he answered ""i wanna help my family out they dont have any money right now"" she gave him an option for online classes he didnt know it was possible to do that and It made him happy.

Finally, getting home schooled is easier and quicker. You can take your classes when ever you are free. If you need to take a break, you can and continue when ever you are ready. it's non-stressful comparing to regular school. Its proven that getting home schooled its less stressful than regular school. Generic_Name is a science teacher at SCHOOL_NAME he said ""88% students are stressed about school because of homework and not having to finish assignments on time"". He also said ""only 5% are stressed when they are home schooled"". In conclusion, it's less stressful and help you feel non-pressured while you are taking your online classes. It also, gives you free time and gives you advantage to do what ever you like. You get to be home and relax wake up when ever you like to, do your classes take brakes if you would like to, too me it sounds amazing!

Some people might say that getting home schooled is bad because if you have any qu+C4estions you dont have a teacher to ask or a physical teacher to help you understand the topic you are learning about but it's a one on one class. There's no students just you and your instructor, it helps you focus which i personally think it will help you more comparing sitting in a class room with your friends not paying attention, playing around or not getting work done. I think it's a good benefit having online classes because it helps with people who have bad situations at school, people who are planning to drop out and its a fast and easier way to get your classes done.",2.5,2,1.5,2,2,2

Many people have their ways of learning certain things. Some may like working in groups because it makes the work easier, bring up their confidence and social life. Others may like working alone because it helps people concentrate, they like to get their work done faster and they don't feel uncomfortable towards other people.

First, Working in groups might make the work easier, help bring up their confidence, or their social life. It can make their work easier by separating the work to make it faster to deal with the work. It can help bring their confidence by talking to other people. It can help them bring courage to make new friends and learn about each other. It can also help them with their social life. Instead of being on their phones they are learning together and getting work done. They are also getting to know each other.

Second, Working alone can help people concentrate in their work, they could be fast workers, and they don't feel uncomfortable towards new people. It can help them by concentrating in their own work to feel more comfortable with themselves. They could be fast workers because they are not being distracted and they can go on their own speed.

There are some reason why I think that be accomplish is better. For some of the people be accomplish is hard to the people because they don't have to much time.

First reason is, be better is because your learn more, you have more experience. We don't wait our time if we do more job if we have to do more job we doing it. We don't have to be to lazy for do more job if we can do the job. Just if we don't have to much time that will be just to done the work. To do accomplish to spend more time doing it. Whatever thing is if we have time we doing it. I work every day if I have to do more work I do it but if I don't have a time do to my work I just done whatever I am doing.

Second reason is do more. do more can be extra work done that will be nice ti have extra work done for the next day if we do the same we don't have to do more. Extra work have to be complete by the time and then dependently what do you do about. When people do extra work in their job the make more money and also they make more overtime hours in their job but no all the job are the same. For me to do more work is more easy for one think I learn more for, another think I just do extra job because I have time and I like too. To more is when we the people have time

Third reason is feelings, why feelings? feelings is because when we do more work that have to be we are satisfy. In other way we feel like when you make a goal when you done. We have emotional feeling when we done the thing what we doing it and also when we accomplish more. After you finish doing the work we feel tired but is not the same when we are satisfy for done. when I do my extra work always measure that is good. When I know is good

I say ""yes I finishing"" and I feel so proud of me. when we do something we have to be positive for every will be okay.

Then, By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere. You can join to the class even if you go to your friends house. Also if you plan to go out the state for few days you can attend to classes from there. Students can enjoy also they can study. They're able to work in online.

In conclusion, for online or video conferencing students doesn't need to worry about there attended. Distance learning students attend classes on time by online. Distance learning students also attend to school everyday. By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere.

I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.",2,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,2
1593,7982F5F494E2,"In my opinion setting a good example is the only way to influence people you're a good person. many people wont believe you're a good person just because you say you are. However, if you show them by how you act like for an example: you don't bother anyone, you show where a location is or try to, being polite, patience, showing manners, etc.

they will find you setting a good example or showing good behavior. Not only setting a good example can make people say you're a good person , it can also lead to ""good karma"".

Lets say you have a younger sibling, and they want to be like you , you can be smart , responsible,and a good behaving person, show them a good example so they can be as successful as you. same goes to people dont show them a bad behavior or example, thats not gonna get you anywhere, that'll only make people not like you and assume different things. Another thing is always set good example when you're out in public with a family member, because if you dont people will not like that and have your family at fault.

in conclusion to all this if you show good behavior or set a good example by showing it , It will not only make people assume you're a good person it will also influence young ones to do the same.     ",2.5,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5
1659,7DDFF6DA8655,"What would make feel much better in class to work alone or in groups? Would it make you feel better and more productive? Some people think that working in groups helps them be more productive and helps them get the job done easier. There could be teachers who wouldnt support the idea of working in groups. If you're trying to convince your teacher you have to have examples to support your position.

Working in a group is more productive and easier it gets the job done quicker then you expect. You can assign each classmate your working with a job duty. One of each classmate can work in drawing, writing, searching up facts about the assignment and not least but last the leader to put everything together and help his classmates when needed. There can be minor things when working in groups. You could expect some who would do there job and just take advantage of time and not be productive. The leader is expected to get there classmates to work and not waste time.

When working alone instead of in groups there can be advantages. Like Having more time in the assignment and not rushing into it. You can have your own ideas without others forcing you to change it up into something they all like. When it comes to mistakes you can point them out yourself and correct them. Instead of stressing about who is not working and who can't get the job done you can work on your own. There could be problems too like not having enough time and can't get your job done as quick as you need it to be. There is other classes to worry about.

Some teachers wouldn't support the idea of working i groups. Instead they would like for you to work alone to get your job done easier. But not every student would support that idea of working alone. Some students could be left back and behind from class so they would need the help from his classmates. There is supporting ideas on why it would be so much better in groups and it would be to get the job done easier and faster. Being alone isn't very helpful when you need the help you do.

Working in groups would not just help students but teachers on grading your work. It can be stressful for them when it comes to working alone and having so much papers to grade. The idea of working with other students would be much more easier and productive. It would feel way better for you and other classmates.          ",2,3.5,2,3,2.5,3
2071,9BAE37CAB3ED,"Dear Teacher,

I think that working in group or working alone has some advantages and disadvantages. But in my opinion I would say that one that is more beneficial is working in a group. Working in a group is less work and more ideas.

As I was saying that their are advantages and disadvantages, My first advantage of working alone is that you get to work alone with no distraction from others. Second advantage is that you can focus and ask the teacher for help. Last reason is that you can put as many ideas you want and a lot of effort and ask the teacher to check your work to see how you doing working. The disadvantage of working alone is that you will not get the work done faster. My second reason is that working alone is not fun because you working independent and doing all the work.

My first advantage is that working in group you get to hear different ideas from each other. My second advantage is that you can talk together and gets lots of ideas and fix mistakes together. Last advantage is that working in a group you can finish the work faster. The first disadvantage is that working in a group their is going to be too much talking and also not focusing. Second disadvantage is that when you are working together some times one person does the whole work and the other doesn't. Last disadvantage is that you can easily get destructive and not get the work done.

To conclude this I think working in a group is more beneficial. I choose working in group because their are many advantages. Therefore working in a group is less work and turning in work fast, As a result you won't have to worry about asking for help or not having ideas because thats is why you are in a group to get your work done and have a lot information.
